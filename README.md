## Project Management and Planning

### Agile Methodology

This project was idealized following the Agile methodology where the user stories were ordered into sprints based on the importance, timeframe and logic flow. 

| Sprint | Description                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Sprint 1 | Project ideation, README, and planning          |
| Sprint 2 | Admin dashboard                                 |
| Sprint 3 | User registration and profile management.           |
| Sprint 4 | Minder listing and booking                      |
| Sprint 5 | Front-end design                                |
| Sprint 6 | Final refinements                               |


### MVC Architecture
This project utilizes the MVC architecture to create a full-stack application.

1. Model - In this stage, I defined the data models for various entities such as User, Booking, and Minder. I also created the Data Model chart, representing the relationships within the database.

2. View - During this stage, I developed interface templates using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These templates render data from the models and present it to the users.

3. Controller - In this stage, I implemented the application's logic. The controllers handle user requests, process data from the models, and update the views accordingly.

4. Connect the Model, View, and Controller -
During this stage, I established connections between the models, views, and controllers. The controllers retrieve data from the models, apply updates based on user input, and pass it to the relevant views or files for rendering.

5. Test and Iterate -In this stage, I thoroughly tested the application to ensure its proper functionality. I made adjustments and conducted multiple iterations to enhance overall performance and user experience.
